# Smart Fire Detection System üî•  

**Smart Fire Detection System** is an advanced IoT solution designed for real-time fire monitoring and prevention. It leverages cutting-edge technologies to detect smoke and gas anomalies, send instant alerts, and provide actionable data for rapid emergency response. The system combines the power of **Jakarta EE**, **MongoDB**, and **Machine Learning** to offer a reliable and scalable safety solution.

## üéØ Objectives  
- **Real-time Smoke and Gas Detection**: Continuously monitor smoke and gas levels in the environment and detect anomalies immediately.  
- **Threshold-Based Alerts**: Send instant notifications to users when smoke levels exceed a predefined threshold, enabling rapid response to potential fire hazards.  
- **Location Tracking via LBS**: Utilize Location-Based Services (LBS) to pinpoint the exact location of detected smoke, allowing emergency responders or users to quickly locate and address the potential fire source.  
- **Data Logging and Historical Analysis**: Store detected events, environmental conditions, and location data for later analysis, helping improve safety protocols and system effectiveness.  
- **Automatic Emergency Call**: If users do not respond to a notification within 1 minute, the system automatically contacts emergency services, ensuring swift assistance in case of fire or gas-related incidents.
